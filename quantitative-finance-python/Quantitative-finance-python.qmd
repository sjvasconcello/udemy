## Present value and future value of money

Key Concepts

- Time Value of Money: Money today is worth more than money in the future due to its potential earning capacity and inflation.
- Present Value (PV): The current value of a future sum of money discounted at a specific interest rate.
- Future Value (FV): The value of a current asset at a future date based on an assumed rate of growth.
  
Investment Scenarios

- Treasury Bills
- Corporate Bonds
- Stocks
  
Investments carry risks, leading to a premium (interest) received.

```{python}
from math import exp

def future_discrete_value(x: float, r: float, n: int):
    return x*(1 + r)**n

def present_discrete_value(x: float, r: float, n: int):
    return x*(1 + r)**-n

def future_continuous_value(x: float, r: float, t: int):
    return x*exp(r*t)

def present_continuous_value(x: float, r: float, t: int):
    return x*exp(-r*t)
```

```{python}
# Value of investment in dollars
x = 100
# Define the interest rate (r)
r  = 0.05
# Duration (years)
n = 5

print("Future values (discrete model) of x: %s" % future_discrete_value(x,r,n))
print("Present values (discrete model) of x: %s" % present_discrete_value(x,r,n))
print("Future values (continuous model) of x: %s" % future_continuous_value(x,r,n))
print("Present values (continuous model) of x: %s" % present_continuous_value(x,r,n))
```

### Calculations
#### Discrete Model

**Future Value**
$$FV = PV \cdot (1+r)^n$$

**Future Value**
$$PV = \frac{FV}{(1+r)^n}$$

- $FV$ = Future Value
- $PV$ = Present Value
- $r$ = Interest Rate
- $n$ = Duration (years)

#### Continuous Model
Using differential equations, the future value in continuous time is modeled by an exponential function.

**Future Value**

$$FV = PV \cdot e^{rt}$$


**Present Value**

$$PV = \frac{FV}{e^{rt}}$$

- $FV$ = Future Value
- $PV$ = Present Value
- $e$ = Base of the natural logarithm
- $r$ = Interest Rate
- $t$ = Duration (years)
